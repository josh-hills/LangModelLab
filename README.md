# LangModelLab

## ðŸš§ Project Status: Early Development ðŸš§

## Overview

LangModelLab is a hands-on educational journey through the evolution of language models - from simple statistical approaches to advanced neural architectures. Each lesson builds incrementally on previous concepts, providing practical implementations with increasingly sophisticated models.

The course is designed as a step-by-step laboratory experience through the following progression:

1. **Bigram Model**: Statistical foundations of language modeling | DONE
2. **N-gram Extensions**: Higher-order models and their limitations | IN PROGRESS
3. **Word Embeddings**: Continuous vector representations
4. **Recurrent Networks**: Sequence modeling with RNNs/LSTMs
5. **Transformers**: Self-attention and modern architectures
6. **Multi-modal Models**: Integrating text with other modalities

## Project Goals

- Provide a clear, incremental learning path from basic statistical models to advanced neural architectures
- Offer hands-on coding exercises with well-documented implementations
- Bridge theoretical concepts with practical implementations
- Make complex language model concepts accessible to intermediate Python programmers

## Getting Started

The project is not yet ready for general use. Once initial lessons are available:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .`
3. Navigate to `lessons/01_bigram_model/` to begin
4. Follow the README in each lesson folder for guidance
