# .cursorrules - FigureGPT Project Guide

## Project Overview
FigureGPT is an educational project that guides learners through the evolution of language models - from simple statistical approaches to complex multi-modal architectures. Each lesson builds incrementally on previous concepts, providing hands-on experience with increasingly sophisticated models.

## Course Structure
1. **Bigram Model**: Statistical foundations of language modeling
2. **N-gram Extensions**: Higher-order models and their limitations
3. **Word Embeddings**: Continuous vector representations
4. **Recurrent Networks**: Sequence modeling with RNNs/LSTMs
5. **Transformers**: Self-attention and modern architectures
6. **Multi-modal Models**: Integrating text with other modalities

## Build & Run Commands
- Setup: `pip install -e .`
- Train model: `python train.py --config configs/default.py`
- Inference: `python sample.py --model_path models/checkpoint.pt`
- Run tests: `pytest tests/`
- Run single test: `pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function -v`
- Lint: `flake8 src/ tests/`
- Type check: `mypy src/ tests/`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use Python type hints throughout
- Format with black (line length 88)
- Sort imports with isort
- Follow PEP 8 naming: snake_case for functions/variables, CamelCase for classes
- Docstrings: Google style with type annotations
- Error handling: Use specific exceptions with informative messages
- Organize imports: stdlib → third-party → local
- Include unit tests for all new functionality
- Keep functions under 50 lines, modules under 500 lines

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -e .`
3. Navigate to `lessons/01_bigram_model/` to begin
4. Follow the README in each lesson folder for guidance
